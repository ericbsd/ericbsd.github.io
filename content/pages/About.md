# About the Blog

This blog is about BSD, Linux, NAS, Open Source, programming, automation, and occasionally ranting about Open Source and tech industry trends. After being away for years, I'm back at it! I am not a professional writer, and English is not my first language, but the more I write, the better I get.

# About Me

My username is **ericbsd** for everything related to BSD, open source, and programming, but my real name is **Eric Turgeon**.

I'm the **founder and lead** of **GhostBSD**, an open source project I started and continue to lead. Additionally, I'm a **FreeBSD ports committer**.

I'm entirely **self-taught** in everything tech-related—programming, automation, BSD, and Linux. My curiosity drives me to constantly learn new things. I started with C, but after learning Python, I switched focus and Python became my favorite language. I also know Java, Groovy, and Go, and I'm currently interested in exploring Zig.

On the automation side, I'm well-versed in pytest, Selenium, requests, websocket, and Jenkins. I've also used Katalon. Fair warning: I'm biased—there's no better filesystem than **OpenZFS**.

**Outside of tech**, I'm a Christian and a father of two sons. My three favorite sports are rugby, mountain biking, and powerlifting. I also enjoy video games.

None of what I do for work or in my free time would be possible without my wife, **Karine**. She's a keeper and irreplaceable.
